## Description

This repository is a self-made project where I was tasked in creating a webpage using the JSON call in JavaScript to retrieve data about Bill Gateâ€™s dogs. In this project, I've used HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This website was a framework for using the JQuery's AJAX / JSON call to retrive data for a JSON file into the web browser for the purpose of experimenting with AJAX / JSON.

## To access the webpage
